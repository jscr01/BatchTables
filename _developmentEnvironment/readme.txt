Dependances
	To properly run the BatchTables Project you will need to include datatables. 
	This is not included as I do not own the rights to DataTables
	Datatables can be found at: https://www.datatables.net/

	You will also require jQuery, which can be found at: https://jquery.com/

	Note, that these dependances are in _ignore/ when you browse the index.html file
